I'm a Senior Researcher with Oracle Labs.  Currently, I'm working on GraalVM's
native image runtime and also strengthening GraalVM's Arm support.

I did my PhD with the
[I-ACOMA](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/){:target="\_blank"} research group and focused
on novel hardware-software co-designs. 
During my PhD, I studied many VM implementations, including V8,
JavaScriptCore, HotSpot, Maxine, and Swift, and designed hardware &
software features to improve their execution. 

My thesis, _Enhancing Non-Volatile Memory_, focused on adding support for
non-volatile memory to Java runtimes and also adding simple hardware support to
reduce the overhead of creating crash-consistent images.

In the past I also spent time at Arm, working with both their NVM research 
and OpenJDK teams.
